## About

[quibbble.com](https://quibbble.com) is a free and [opensource](https://github.com/quibbble) boardgame server created to provide a virtual game table in the absence of a real one.

In 2020 quibbble was started as a hobby Covid project for Tsuro and has since expanded into a number of other games with more to come.

Since starting, thousands of players have played games in the quibbble ecosystem all **100% for free**. Most "*free*" website continue to exist by selling ad space or user data. Others will hide away premium features to generate revenue. Quibbble does none of this and never will. Expenses are kept at a minimum and paid out of pocket as a service to those who love boardgames.

If you enjoy quibbble and are interested in helping out then there are a number of ways you can contribute:
- **‚å®Ô∏è** Poke around our [github](https://github.com/quibbble) and write some code. We are always looking for devs who are interested in adding a new game. 
- **üíµ** Help pay for server costs through [buymeacoffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/quibbble). Just $5 goes a long way to keeping the lights on.
- **üí¨** Join our [discord](https://discord.com/invite/VKvjutuhUp) to find a game or talk with community members. We love to hear your suggestions for how to improve the site.

As always, thanks for playing and supporting [quibbble.com](https://quibbble.com).
